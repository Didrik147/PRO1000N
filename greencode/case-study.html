      An Investigative Study</h1>

    <p class="text-lg">In the age of rapidly evolving artificial intelligence, "Do Generative AI Tools Ensure Green Code?" by Samarth Sikand and collegues investigates a critical but underexplored question: can generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Google BARD, and GitHub Copilot generate code that is environmentally sustainable by default? The study assesses whether these tools adhere to well-known sustainable coding practices, commonly referred to as “green code”, which are vital in reducing the environmental footprint of software systems.

    <h2>Context and Motivation</h2>
    <p>Software sustainability is an emerging priority as the digital sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. Estimates suggest that ICT could account for up to 14% of global emissions by 2040. The underlying problem is the widespread use of energy-inefficient coding patterns. With more developers now relying on generative AI tools for writing code, the responsibility for producing sustainable software is increasingly shared between human developers and AI.
      While much research has assessed AI-generated code in terms of security, correctness, and maintainability, its environmental impact has largely been ignored. The 2024 article written by Sikand et al. addresses that gap by evaluating how well AI-generated code aligns with sustainable software development practices.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Research Design and Methodology</h2>
    <p>The authors created a set of six green coding rules, five drawn from CAST’s Green IT rulebook and one based on energy efficiency in Java I/O APIs. These rules reflect energy-saving strategies such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using StringBuilder instead of string concatenation in loops.</li>
      <li>Avoiding Hashtable in favor of HashMap.</li>
      <li>Managing file resources properly in Python.</li>
      <li>Replacing inefficient I/O APIs in Java.</li>
      <li>Preferring loop-based iteration over forEach() in JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Using energy-efficient database column types.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each rule was associated with two natural language prompts designed to test how each AI tool responded without being directly instructed to optimize for sustainability. The tools (ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot) were then evaluated based on whether their code outputs adhered to these sustainable practices.</p>
    

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>The results were telling: None of the tools consistently followed green coding practices by default. In fact, many of the generated solutions used energy-inefficient code, especially in scenarios where best practices were well-established. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For Java I/O operations (Rule 1), all three tools defaulted to using inefficient classes like Scanner, rather than optimal alternatives.</li>
      <li>Copilot had the weakest performance overall, with non-compliance in 5 out of the 6 rules tested.</li>
      <li>ChatGPT and BARD showed slightly better performance, but still failed to consistently produce sustainable code across all rules.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>Sitkand et al. make a compelling case for the importance of sustainability in AI-assisted coding. The study provides early, yet valuable evidence that current generative AI tools are not equipped to prioritize energy efficiency by default. This is significant because as these tools become integral to mainstream software development, their environmental impact scales with their adoption.
      </p>
      <p>One of the strengths of the study is its clear, replicable methodology: selecting testable rules, crafting targeted prompts, and manually verifying outputs. However, the authors also acknowledge several limitations:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The study only included six rules and three AI tools.</li>
        <li>Many sustainability rules are complex and difficult to evaluate through natural language prompts.</li>
        <li>The experiment didn't test the tools' responses to prompts that explicitly requested green code, only their default behaviour.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Despite these limitations, the findings offer valuable insights. The study reveals that AI-generated code, while syntactically correct and functionally effective, is not necessarily optimized for energy efficiency. The authors suggest that better results could be achieved by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fine-tuning AI models on datasets that emphasize sustainable coding practices.</li>
          <li>Using prompt engineering to explicitly request green code.</li>
          <li>Embedding green rule-checkers or linters in development workflows to catch inefficient patterns.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion and Implications</h2>
      <p>This study is a timely reminder that AI is not inherently sustainable. Without intentional design or intervention, generative AI tools will continue to favor conventional coding patterns—many of which are not energy efficient. As AI-generated code becomes ubiquitous, developers, researchers, and toolmakers need to ensure that sustainability is treated as a first-class concern alongside performance, security, and maintainability.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, "Do Generative AI Tools Ensure Green Code?" serves as a foundational call to action. It highlights a crucial intersection of AI, software engineering, and environmental responsibility, urging the community to look beyond functionality and begin designing systems that are not just smart, but also sustainable.
